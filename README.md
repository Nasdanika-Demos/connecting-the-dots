# Drawio Site

This is a template repository for web sites generated from [Drawio](https://www.drawio.com/) diagrams with [GitHub Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions) and [Nasdanika CLI Drawio Command](https://docs.nasdanika.org/nsd-cli/nsd/drawio/index.html).


## Demos

Below is a list of sites created from this template:

* [Bob the builder](https://nasdanika-demos.github.io/bob-the-builder/), this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtifPFetg9o) shows how this demo was created.
* [Internet Banking System](https://nasdanika-demos.github.io/internet-banking-system/index.html) - a sample C4 Model documented using this template/approach.
* [Declarative Command Pipelines](https://nasdanika-demos.github.io/declarative-command-pipelines/) - illustrations for a Medium story. This demo show how to create a site from a diagram with multiple top-level pages.
* More demos on [Nasdanika Demos](https://github.com/orgs/Nasdanika-Demos/repositories)

## Steps

* On the [repository page](https://github.com/Nasdanika-Templates/drawio-site) click "Use this template" button in the top right.
* Once you create a new repository, go to the Settings > Pages and select "GitHub Actions" as source.
* Click on the Acitons tab. You should see a failed deployment. Manually trigger ``Generate HTML Site from a Drawio diagram with Nasdanika CLI`` action. Once it is successful, open the pages site.
* Customize the diagram, root action, and page template to your needs as explained below.

The deployment action can be triggered manually from the actions page. 
It can be useful if your site references external resources.

For example:

* The diagram file may link to pages in external diagrams (federated diagrams)
* The diagram file may reference external documentation resources

## Deployment process

* [Nasdanika CLI](https://docs.nasdanika.org/nsd-cli/index.html) is downloaded and extracted
* [drawio](https://docs.nasdanika.org/nsd-cli/nsd/drawio/index.html) <diagram file> [html-app](https://docs.nasdanika.org/nsd-cli/nsd/drawio/html-app/index.html) ... [site](https://docs.nasdanika.org/nsd-cli/nsd/drawio/html-app/site/index.html) ... command pipeline is executed to generate a Web site
* The generated site is deployed to [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/). 

## Diagram file

You may rename ``diagram.drawio`` to something more meaningful, e.g.``my-system.drawio``. 
Or you may use a pre-existing drawio diagram and delete ``diagram.drawio``. 
You can also use an external diagram and reference it by URL.
If you do rename/replace the diagram, open ``.github/workflows/site.yml`` and update line 40 with a new diagram file name.

## Page template

In the page template file you can:

* Modify the [theme](https://javadoc.io/doc/org.nasdanika.html/bootstrap/latest/org.nasdanika.html.bootstrap/org/nasdanika/html/bootstrap/Theme.html) on line 3 - choose one of 20+ [Bootswatch themes](https://bootswatch.com/4/) or the default theme. Please note that generated sites look good with light themes, and not so good (in my personal opinion) with dark themes.
* Highly recommended: remove out-of-the-box Google analytics script at lines 23-33 - replace it with your own or remove the header section (lines 22-33) altogether. 
* Remove line 36 or set ``fluid`` to ``false``.
* Modify [navigation panel style](https://html-app.models.nasdanika.org/references/eClassifiers/NavigationPanelStyle/index.html) at line 38

## Root action

The root action defines:

* The header (root action[^action_types]). You may modify the icon and the title. 
* Root navigation actions - lines 6 - 20. Glossary and search are functional, but not perfect - they need TLC, which I don't have capacity for at the moment. You may use them AS-IS, remove/replace, or improve and create a pull request. Their advantage is that they are standalone - no external dependencies. For public web sites you may consider something like [Algolia](https://www.algolia.com) - they have a [free tier](https://www.algolia.com/pricing/) and a [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/) search component, [InstantSearch](https://www.algolia.com/doc/guides/building-search-ui/what-is-instantsearch/vue/)
* Footer (root navigation) at lines 21+. Out of the box is links to the template repository site - update or remove.

[^action_types]: See [Action types](https://html-app.models.nasdanika.org/index.html#action-types)

## Diagram elements

You can add documentation to diagram elements, ``title`` and ``icon`` property, customize element ID, and link elements to pages or other elements, including pages and elements in other diagram files.

Site pages are generated only for elements with documentation.

Important: Pages are not generated for diagram elements without labels or ``title`` property! It may lead to broken links.

### Documentation

You can add inline documentation in ``documentation`` property as it is done for [Alice](https://nasdanika-templates.github.io/drawio-site/alice/index.html).

Documentation is by default treated as Markdown. 
Use ``doc-format`` property to specify documentation format.
Out of the box there are 3 formats supported:

* ``markdown``
* ``html``
* ``text``

You can add support for more formats, e.g. [Asciidoc](https://docs.asciidoctor.org/asciidoc/latest/) using [AsciidoctorJ](https://github.com/asciidoctor/asciidoctorj) - see "Adding support for documentation format" below. 

You may reference an external documentation resources with ``doc-ref`` property - this how it is done for the diagram root (click on the diagram canvas and then on "Edit Data" button in the right panel). 
Documentation reference is a URL resolved relative to the diagram file location.

If you use ``doc-ref`` property, the documentation format is inferred from the extension. 
You may override the inferred value using ``doc-format`` property.

### Title

By default the element label is used as action text. 
For elements with long labels it may be desirable to use shorter text. 
To do so use ``title`` property.

### Icon

By default element icons are derived from element images where possible. 
Otherwise a default icon is used.
You may use ``icon`` property to customize element icon. 
The icon can be a URL (including data URL) or a CSS style e.g. ``fas fa-user``.

### ID 

Element ID's are used to construct element page URL's. 
Element ID's are generated as long random strings. 
They are editable - double-click on the ID at the top of the data dialog.
So, if you'd like to have semantic URL's - customize the ID's.  

## Page and element links

You may link elements to pages and other element using the [extended link syntax](https://docs.nasdanika.org/core/drawio/index.html#page-and-element-links).

When an element links to a page, the page root[^api] is logically merged with the linking element and page elements (except elements liking to other elements) become logical children of the linking element.

If an element links to another element, then that element is not considered a logical child of the page/root/page linking element. 
The link chain is traversed and the diagram element on the generated site is linked to the page of the link target element if that element has a page (i.e. it is documented). Otherwise there is no link.

[^api]: See [Drawio API](https://docs.nasdanika.org/core/drawio/index.html#api)

## Multiple top-level pages

A top-level diagram page is a page that is not linked from any diagram element. 
If there is more than one top-level page, then you may want to add a principal action to the ``root-action.yml`` and link pages to the principal action by removing ``--add-to-root`` option from the command line.

See [Declarative Command Pipelines](https://nasdanika-demos.github.io/declarative-command-pipelines/) for an example.

## Icons

Drawio has more than two thousand built-in icons. You can find more icons on the below sites:

* [FlatIcons](https://www.flaticon.com/pricing) - 16.8 million icons. Free with attribution, a paid plan is available - no attribution.
* [IconFinder](https://www.iconfinder.com/) - the world's largest marketplace for icons, ... 6 million icons at your fingertips including free icons. Multiple subscription levels.

  ```

results in this diagram:

```mermaid
flowchart LR
   Alice --> Bob & Chuck --> Deb
```

##### Loading from a resource

It is also possible to load a diagram definition from a resource resolved relative to the model resource:

    ```mermaid-resource
    sequence.mermaid
    ```

### Extensions

* [Table of contents](https://github.com/vsch/flexmark-java/wiki/Table-of-Contents-Extension) - add ``[TOC]`` to the document as explained in the documentation. This extension will create a table of contents from markdown headers. 
* [Footnotes](https://github.com/vsch/flexmark-java/wiki/Footnotes-Extension)
* Strikethrough: ``~~strikethrough~~``-> ~~strikethrough~~ 
* Subscript: ``H~2~O`` -> H~2~0
* Superscript: ``2^5^ = 32`` -> 2^5^ = 32

## Failing on errors

``-r=-1`` command line option means "don't fail on page errors" such as:

* Blank pages
* Broken internal links
* Missing resources

Missing resources are reported on pages using danger alert blocks.

If you want to prevent deployment of a site with page errors, remove the option or set it to the expected number of errors - there might be "known errors" which you are OK to live with.

## Upgrading NSD CLI version

When a new version of Nasdanika CLI is released you may update lines 33 and 35 in ``site.yml`` to point to the new distribution.

## Adding support for a new documentation format

To add a new documentation format:

* Create a Maven module
* Create a documentation [capability](https://docs.nasdanika.org/core/capability/index.html) factory class, see [MarkdownDocumentationFactory](https://github.com/Nasdanika/core/blob/master/exec/src/main/java/org/nasdanika/exec/util/MarkdownDocumentationFactory.java)
* Register it in ``module-info.java`` - [example](https://github.com/Nasdanika/core/blob/master/exec/src/main/java/module-info.java)
* Build a custom CLI with the above module as a dependency. See [Demo CLI](https://github.com/Nasdanika-Demos/cli) for an example.
* Build a distribution, deploy to a web location, and update ``site.yml`` lines 33 and 35.

## Next steps

This section outlines possible next steps once you have a site generated from a diagram or a set of diagrams.

### Executable diagrams

You may make the diagrams executable. Details and demos are coming soon.

#### Scripted processors

#### Dynamic proxy

#### HTTP Routes

### Semantic mapping

You can also "upgrade" to semantic mapping as explained in the [Beyond Diagrams](https://leanpub.com/beyond-diagrams) book and TODO story.
